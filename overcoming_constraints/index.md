# Overcoming constraints

##  What
Constraints could relate to the project, the product or the organisation. They might typically be:

- Strategy
- Technical - what can be built? what is architecturally strategic?
- Resourcing
- Access to users
- Time/speed
- Policy - what are you allowed to do?
- Dependencies - Do you need any other projects to have delivered before you research, design or build?
- Data/Analytics - Are there tooling limitations on what you can learn? Are you allowed to collect all the data you would ideally want
- Security

If options are documented in a way that allows comparison of benefits and costs then Governance will find it easier to support you in overcoming constraints.

If no options can be identified that can be delivered within the constraints then a decision is required from Governance on how to proceed.

Thought out and documented constraints will help you make recommendations at this level.

## Why
A clear articulation of the constraints will also help:

- make both tactical and strategic decisions, this is especially important given the scrutiny that the NHS is under in many areas (budgets, project choice, timelines etc...).
- you engage the governance layer of programme management if you encounter issues in delivering work
- inform other teams in their work

## When
If you encounter a constraint set about understanding the constraint straight away.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Flag constraints to governance as soon as you've confirmed them.


Try to document constraints as early as possible as it will help you plan your activity. If you know you have a resourcing constraint at a given time then you may be able to work around it, or if you are dependent on another project's delivery then it might be possible to have it prioritised at the programme level by Governance.

## How
Understanding constraints is about understanding impact. A basic approach is to answer the following questions:

- What type of constraint do you have?
- What type of impact will this have on the output? e.g.
  - Quality is worse?
  - Takes longer to deliver?
  - Less confident in fit for purpose?
  - Higher cost?
  - Scope is limited?
- Which areas can you compromise on? Which ones can you not?
- What are your options?
- How does each option change the impact identified? What are the costs and benefits?
- What do you need to enact each option? What is the process to make this change happen?


> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Once constraints have been identified it is a good idea to involve relevant SMEs to discuss them with. Often what appear to be constraints initially fade way or become opportunities when fully understood.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Consider the project through a series of lenses to see where the root cause of the constraints are. Are they clustered in one or a few areas?

## Who
- Project team
- Technical architects
- Governance
- Relevant SME for the constraint type: Security or policy experts that work across the NHS or NHS Digital
