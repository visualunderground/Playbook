# Mapping User Journeys

## What

A User Journey (or journey Map) detailed, experience-centric visual document that captures the customer experience across touch points, including what the customer is doing, thinking, and/or feeling. It charts all the ways, types, frequencies, and positive/negative aspects of the touch points that the brand has with its users. This could be a single set of touch points across multiple channels to achieve a single aim.

User Journeys can chronicle all the conditions surrounding a single interaction, including emotion and external circumstances.

Useful when designing a new user experience:

- Understanding the ideal world of a customers wishes and desires
- Seeing what services could fit seamlessly into this customers world (discovery of user experience)

Useful when understanding a current user experience:

- Showing complete picture of the activities to accomplish a high level goal, both where they interact with the organisation and their other tasks
- Ratings of satisfaction with the process is often useful data (discovery of customer pain-points)

## Why
- helps you see where people interact with the NHS in the context of your project
- focus on particular needs at different stages in the whole life journey
- Work out if things are happening in the right order, or if the order is important
- shows gaps between the desired user experience and the one actually received
- Highlights priorities

## When

- **Discovery:** When understanding how users experience the current service. Also when looking to map user's expectations or desires for new services.
- **Alpha and beyond:** When mapping new services

## How
- Prepare and print out data
- Choose main persona
- Define scale and scope (timeframe and stages)
- Create steps in the journey
- Iterate and refine
- Add lanes (for specific aspects of the journey)

## Who
- Project team
