# Using Personas

## What
Personas are composite characters created from the behaviours and psychologies of your target users derived from previous user interviews and contextual studies. Each persona should represent a specific segment of users with specific information. These should ideally be built up from User Profiles.

Personas usually include a name, picture, user quotes and representative scenarios with a focus on the users’ goals, motivation, and behaviour. Interviews and contextual studies often provide the raw research that’s shaped into a persona.

## Why
Personas are useful for:
- Helping team members understand and empathise with their users, their needs and goals—and thus create better products.
- Making crucial design decisions, for example, “What kind of sign-up process would Pricilla the Pensioner prefer?”
- Organisational memory

## When
Discovery - when seeking to summarise the user behaviours, needs etc found during your initial research

Beyond - keeping updated when new findings occur

## How
- Do your research. Ideally a combination of qualitative and quantitative research.
- Analyse your results and group users according to meaningful differences relevant to your project.
- Create personas
- Iterate


> 💡 **TIP:** You might create lean personas or empathy maps initially. Later on you can create more fleshed out personas.
