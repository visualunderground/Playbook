# Documenting your work

## What
- Lean documentation does NOT mean no documentation - document things as you go!
- Documents include everything from post-it notes, photographs and sketches to word docs, powerpoints and visual artefacts like user journeys
- Documents should be tools used to facilitate further conversations/ideation/iteration etc and not just a way to retrospectively record findings
- Document things relevant to your project, don't waste time and effort on things that aren't
- Keep documentation lightweight (sketches or photos are fine unless you need to display something shiny to those outside the project team)

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Do just enough, just in time - and remember it's OK to have gaps as these can be filled in later!

## Why
- **Organisational memory:** Up-to-date, relevant documentation makes it easier to bring new people into the team. There is a high amount of staff turnover on projects at the NHS and multiple suppliers. Robust documentation improves handover and continuity of work
- **Traceability:** Your documentation should make it clear how you know what you know, and on what basis you've made decisions (from research through to design and prototyping)
- **Quality:** Documenting as you go means that you capture what you need to while it is fresh in your mind, ensuring a more accurate reflection of reality
- **Sharing:** Insights need to be digested by other projects to support their work. We have a responsibility at the NHS to share our findings with the wider organisation

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** A picture paints a thousand words!
>
> Visualising findings or ideas (diagrams, pictures or video) is often a better way to convey in a powerful way the story you want to tell.

## When
All the time! Whenever your understanding changes you should make sure it's captured

## How
Think about your audience and the level of detail and message that you need to convey to them:
- Leadership
- Your team
- Other teams
- Wider NHS

Given the above consider which format and channel will be most appropriate
Keep all your documents (including source files) on confluence!

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Include key artefacts in your Definition of Done
>
>Creating a task in Jira for each one helps you track progress and ensure that they are done at the right time.

## Who
- The user researcher usually owns the user needs matrix
- The service designer usually owns the user journeys and service blueprints

However, the whole team should constantly contribute to project documentation.

## Key documentation
- Inception brief
- Workshop brief
- User research plans
- User profiles/personas
- User needs matrix: sets of needs for different types of users
- User journeys: describes your usersâ€™ current experience
- Experience maps: show how users interact with existing or future services and the needs they have at each stage
- Service blueprints: An end-to-end, front-to-back depiction of the service
- Epics: a large User Story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. In the backlog
- User stories: A software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language. In the backlog
- Prototypes
