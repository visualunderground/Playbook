# Using Service Blueprints

## What

A detailed, process-centric, map that captures the whole service delivery process across touch points, including the back stage and front stage of the service delivery.

Service blueprints contain fewer experience details than User Journeys Maps, but more information about the processes that deliver the service. At their most extreme, User Journeys Map are more experience-centric and service blueprints are more process-centric.

Useful when understanding a current service experience:

- **End-to-end:** Visualising the path followed by consumers across multiple channels
- **Front-to-back:** Identifying how the company structure is organised and operates to service the customers needs (understanding implementation of business processes). This organisation may influence the User Journey

Useful when designing a new service experience:

- **End-to-end:** Visualising the paths you want users to follow across multiple channels
- **Front-to-back:** Identifying clearly what the NHS and partners need to get in-place to service defined customer needs (implementation of business processes)

## Why

There's value in creating and having a Service Blueprint:

The process of creating one forces you to start with the user journey and understand how it will be delivered as a service, from interactions with front line services through to the back end services and technology that supports them. You can then:

- Understand the way the current whole service works, who is involved and how
- Explore feasibility of the desired service experience
- Adjust the desired experience to match the capabilities of the NHS to deliver it
- Define an “MVP” of how the NHS might deliver the desired experience 
- Gain alignment across all business silos and stakeholders about the desired service experience, and how will we deliver that experience as an organisation 

Once you have a blueprint you can use it to explain the service to senior leadership, on-board new starters and explain to people working on the solution how their area fits into the journey or meets user needs.

## When
- **Discovery:** To map out the user journey and supporting services as they are currently
- **Alpha:** To map out the proposed services to understand how they would might be supported and assess feasibility
- **Beta:** To map out the proposed service in detail
- **Beyond:** To map out the new, current service in detail

## How
There are many ways to create a service blueprint and many forms. The details of what you include will depend upon your service and need at the time.

At it's most basic it will need the following:

1. user journey
1. front stage - touchpoints (people, things, processes, etc) with which the user has direct contact
1. backstage - people and processes which are invisible to the user
1. behind the scenes - support processes - activities executed by the rest of the organisation or external partners

You can add other elements depending on what you wish to communicate:

- user perspectives
- actors
- emotional journey
- technical systems
- data collected/required
- relevant policies
- etc

### Designing a new service

Things to consider:

- What service should we be offering?
- What is the ideal client experience?
- How feasible is the ideal client experience?
- How might your organisation deliver the desired client experience?
- Gain alignment across all business silos and stakeholders about the desired client experience, and how will we deliver that experience as an organisation 
- Create a checklist for service development and implementation (these can easily be turned into epics and user stories in the backlog at the appropriate time)

> 💡 **TIP:** Envisioning new service experiences and the business models and structures to support those experiences is complex. Lay the appropriate groundwork by doing the following:
>
>- Current-state service blueprinting 
>- User research
>- Problem framing
>- Value proposition
>- Storyboarding
>- Future-state journey mapping
