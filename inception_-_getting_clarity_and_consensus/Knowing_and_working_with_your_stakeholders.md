# Knowing and working with your stakeholders

##What
Stakeholder Mapping to identify your key project influencers, supporters and opposers.

The stakeholder matrix, mind map and onion are simple, but very effective tools for analysing stakeholders.

## Why
Stakeholder management is crucial for project planning and execution.

Each stakeholder is different and knowing what their aims, influence, support and level of interest in your project are will show you how best to manage them, making it easier to deliver your project:

Map them using different lenses in order to identify their objectives, understand how best to develop relationships with them, address their expectations and communicate with them as you go.

## When
As early on as possible!

At the start of the Inception phase:

- Engage the stakeholders that will influence or be influenced by your project
- Get their support and help to define your project at an early stage
- Build understanding and plan ahead based on their reactions


> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
> Update your mapping as existing stakeholder relationships are improved and new stakeholders emerge.
> You should also revisit your stakeholder map at the start of each new phase to make sure new players are included.

## How

Several techniques can be used. The most important thing is to get a clear overview of your stakeholders and their importance in the project by the end of the process.

It is useful to follow these general steps:

1. Identify your stakeholders (people or organizations who are affected by your work, who have influence over it or any interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion.
1. Prioritise you stakeholders by relevant criteria
1. Place each stakeholder on the map.
1. Understand your key stakeholders.
1. Get in touch with them and find out how they feel about it.
1. Agree on a way to engage them and communicate progress.

When using a quadrant or matrix:

1. A graph is drawn and split into four quadrants or perhaps 3 x 3.
1. Stakeholders are analysed against certain criteria and plotted on the map
1. The completed map enables decisions to be made based on the quadrant that a particular stakeholder falls into.
