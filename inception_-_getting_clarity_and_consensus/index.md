# Inception - Getting clarity and consensus

## What

A very short inception phase to clarify and confirm the scope of the project. A way to get clarity on the problem we are solving and a focus for our work before we start Discovery.

## Why

The purpose of the inception phase is to:

- Get a shared understanding of the problem(s) and outcomes
- Get a view on availability of people and plans for stakeholder engagement
- Collate existing sources of insight into the problem that can be used to support Discovery
- Identify any potential blockers to the work (e.g. technical / policy / legal / commercial)
- Identify dependencies / risks to achieving a successful Disco
- Agree approach to Discovery

Your Inception phase should be no longer than 1 week and can be as short as 1 day. In other organisations you will see longer Inception phases, but this is because they are in charge of identifying the problems. The problems and context are agreed for us from our commissioners (in most cases) therefore we can (and should) have a shorter duration.

## When
Ideally the Inception should happen an ample amount of time before the Discovery as you may need to change your Discovery team profile based on the information received from the commissioners. Therefore, we would suggest you complete your inception 1-2 weeks before Discovery is due to start.
