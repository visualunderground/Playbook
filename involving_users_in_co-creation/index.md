# Involving users in co-creation

## What
Co-creation (also called co-design, participatory design, etc) brings users into the ideation and design process.

Project teams and stakeholders take part in activities with users, providing them with materials and triggers for them to descriptively discuss their personal experiences and express their ideal solutions.

Co-creation processes are often more efficient than traditional design research because all parties discuss the problem and solutions together, and essentially combining research, ideation and prototyping.

It should work alongside the many other methods and types of design research.

## Why
Involving the project team (and stakeholders where possible) directly with users means:

- It increases empathy among stakeholders and designers
- It forces stakeholders and project teams to confront the realities of customer emotions â€“ be that happiness, joy, anger, or frustration â€“ and the motivations behind their behaviour.
- It promotes constructive reflection and dialogue where all parties involved are equal, and working together towards a shared goal
- Designers and stakeholders are better able to understand the reasons behind the requirements, which leads to better decision making during design and project phases
- Risks are reduced when involving users early and throughout and ensure that you are:
  - answering the right question
  - designing the right thing
  - building the right thing, in the right way
- Users really care about Health, it's the base of pyramid of needs.
- Users of the NHS are from all parts of the general public, who funds the NHS, so it's critical to co-create to ensure the service is for everyone


> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Involving all team members directly engaging with users is a great way to increase empathy and understanding by making user needs tangible. This first hand experience is invaluable when the team need to tell the story about what they are doing and why it is important to key stakeholders and decision makers.

## When
In every phase, preferably several times as the team iterates through the design!

## How
Ensure you have done adequate user research and have articulated your problem and findings clearly so that participants can understand them. Ultimately good ideas will depend on good research.

Use techniques where participants write, draw or otherwise create expressions of their ideas so that all members contribute, while avoiding common group dynamics issues such as groupthink, unbalanced contributions and hierarchy bias.

Use a dedicated facilitator to run the session. Ensure you have enough facilitators for the number of participants.

### Getting users

- Ensure recruitment and inclusion of users is in the plan and budget for each phase
- Ensure that all appropriate user groups are considered - including those with accessibility needs and other outsiders / extreme users
- Engage with the user research leads early on to understand how best to recruit for your group of users

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Be mindful of ethical and privacy considerations and guidance - if in doubt, check with the user research leads

### A few rules

Co-creation is really about involving users in the kinds of workshop activities that you may usually consider doing only with the project team. There are a myriad of different workshop formats out there and the right one depends upon what you're trying to solve, with whom, how many of them there are and the place you're in.

Nevertheless, there are some useful rules to follow whatever ideation technique you're using:

1. Set time limits
1. Defer judgement
1. Encourage wild ideas
1. Build on the ideas of others
1. Stay focused on the topic
1. One conversation at a time
1. Be visual, and make things
1. Go for quantity

### Ideation Techniques

A few examples of popular techniques are listed here - there are many more options, so check out the links below for inspiration!

- Warm-Up Exercise: Get participants comfortable to contribute and get the creative juice flowing
- Brainstorming: For subtle but important variations on this see also Brainwriting, Brainwalking and Braindumping
- Storytelling: A more narrative expression of ideas
- Design Studio: Visual but with a formal critique and improve cycle

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Involving users in research, design or testing should form part of your Definition of Done. This will ensure that user involvement doesn't get de-prioritised.

## Who
- Project team
- Stakeholders
- Users (Internal and External)
