# Evaluating your ideas

## What
The process of evaluating, comparing, ranking, clustering and even ditching your ideas in an attempt to pull together a few great ideas to take forward to prototyping.

## When
At some point in your ideation session or project (after several ideation sessions), youâ€™ll have reached a [critical mass](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/critical-mass) of ideas, and it will become unproductive to attempt to keep pushing for more. This is when you ned to evaluate them:

- Once an ideation session has finished, itâ€™s time to collect, categorise, refine and narrow down the best idea, solution, or strategy.
- End of initial ideation evaluation work and it's time to choose which ideas should be taken forward to prototyping.

The project team should have done the following:

- [ ] done several rounds of ideation involving stakeholders and users
- [ ] established a design vision
- [ ] collated all ideas
- [ ] created hypotheses

## Why
While no idea is a bad idea during ideation, the same is not true moving forward. It is vital that all final ideas are evaluated against the same relevant criteria so that only the best, viable ideas are then used to design or build something.


> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Hang onto those unused ideas, though; they may prove useful in future ideation sessions as stokers or idea triggers.

## How
It is useful to measure all ideas agains the same criteria. The details of these criteria will depend upon the project. However, you should include user, organisational and technical considerations as a minimum.

There are many ways to evaluate ideas and decide which should be prototyped. Some suggested methods (see links):

- Dot voting
- Four Categories Method
- Bingo Selection
- Idea Affinity Diagram
- Six thinking Hats
- No How Wow Matrix
- Need, Approach, Benefit, Competition Method (NABC)

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Make sure you have significantly different ideas that make it to the last few so that you can test and explore a few different routes to a winner. Ideas that are very similar can be batch prototyped, with some variation in prototype iterations.

## Who
- Project team
- Stakeholders
- Users
