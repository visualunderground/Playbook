# Using your research

## What
> "How do I choose direction"

> "How do I bring quant and qual together"

Often we don't fully understand what data we can access that's relevant to our work, or what that data really means in context. It's also common half way through a discovery to become overwhelmed with the amount of data you've gathered - Data comes from multiple sources and has many different forms, both qualitative and quantitative.

If you are able to identify precise end to end journeys you may be able to analyse conversion, which lets you understand how many people are making it from one step to another. Find the biggest step drop in conversion, this is where you are losing the most people.

## Why
- It is important to take advantage of both quantitative (the what) and qualitative (the why) during your research.
- Making sense of research, identifying themes and patterns, developing insights, etc builds a strong foundation for projects to continue
- It is important that project teams don't waste all of their time running experiments on unimportant and known aspects of your product: Focus on what matters
- It's crucial in ensuring the project goes in the right direction

## When
Speak to the data and analytics team about your project as soon as you are able. Explain to them the project's objectives, what phase you are at and what you want to measure, they might be able to help you understand what data is available and what it means.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** You don't always need to go to them with a precise question!

Once you have completed research (at least a round of it) and are looking to develop insights and deeper understanding.

## How
Use both quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of sources to get a well rounded data set.

Research throws up a lot of data. It is useful to document as you go and make findings tangible using formats such as personas, user journeys, service blueprints, etc. Be careful when summarising small research sets, say '50% of the 20 people interviewed' as opposed to just '50% of people'.

Visualise everything, turn unstructured findings into themes, patterns, insights and opportunity areas. Between 3 and 15 key research findings is sensible, 200 separate insights are not.

The following exercises give you the power to facilitate a conversation with your team and enable them to focus on what matters.

- Affinity mapping and clustering
- Priority mapping
- Assumption mapping
- Impact mapping
- Kano method (backlog)
- Physically on a wall board table
- Use collaboration to bring different perspectives

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** It can be a really useful exercise to sense-check your understanding of what your findings mean with users. Sometimes they will see different patterns, insights and opportunities.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** When investigating opportunities, think about areas of influence and potential lean experiments to validate hypothesis/test feasibility

## Who
- Project team
- User Researcher
- Stakeholder
- Users
- Discuss as a team - Product owner decides with sponsor
